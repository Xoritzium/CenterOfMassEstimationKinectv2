3. open the the project and the "CenterOfMassCalculation" scene
4. Ensure, the Game View is set to 1920x1080, otherwise the representation of the center of Mass might be weird.

Make sure, the Kinect SDK is installed properly and the kinect sensor is connected to your mashine.
Maybe test with the Kinect Studio provided by the SDK if the sensor is working properly.
